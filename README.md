Ticklish Penguin
================

Your program is to write a program that moves something in a random walk using P5's [`random()`](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/random) function. Check the samples of student work at the bottom for some ideas. You may also find slides 212 - 231 in the [slide presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fm_Di0qR4HpRWTf8tJtcW3u5by3OrilfXIPZ517K1js/edit?usp=sharing) helpful. Have fun and be creative!

While you could use your picture from the penguin assignment, you may find it easier to move a simpler shape like an ellipse. Since the x and y coordinates of the shape will be changing, we will need variables for each. After declaring and intitializing the variables, add code in `draw()` or `mousePressed()` to change the variables that hold the x and y coordinates a small amount using `random()` every time the screen is drawn or the mouse is pressed.
