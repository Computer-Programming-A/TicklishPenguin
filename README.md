Ticklish Penguin
================

Your program is to write a program that moves something in a random walk using P5's [`random()`](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/random) function. Check the samples of student work at the bottom for some ideas. Have fun and be creative!

While you could use your picture from the penguin assignment, you may find it easier to move a simpler shape like an ellipse. Since the x and y coordinates of the shape will be changing, we will need variables for each. After declaring and intitializing the variables, add code in `draw()` or `mousePressed()` to change the variables that hold the x and y coordinates a small amount using `random()` every time the screen is drawn or the mouse is pressed.
