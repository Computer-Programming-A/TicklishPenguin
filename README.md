Ticklish Penguin
================

In this assignmnet you will write a program that moves something in a random walk using P5's [`random()`](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/random) function. What's a random walk? Check out [Andrea Schmidt's web page on random walks](http://www.mit.edu/~kardar/teaching/projects/chemotaxis(AndreaSchmidt)/random.htm) that describes how computer programmers write software using random walks to model real life phenomena like the weather, the stock market, baseball, chemistry and how animals search for food.

For your ticklish penguin, you could move your picture from the previous penguin assignment in a random walk, or you could move some other shape. Since the x and/or y coordinates of the shape will be changing, we will need variables for each changing coordinate. After declaring and intitializing the variables, add code in `draw()`to change the variables a small amount using `random()` every time the screen is drawn or the mouse is pressed. Check the samples of student work at the bottom for some ideas. You may also find slides 216 - 242 in the [slide presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fm_Di0qR4HpRWTf8tJtcW3u5by3OrilfXIPZ517K1js/edit?usp=sharing) helpful. Have fun and be creative!
